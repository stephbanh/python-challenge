# Python-challenge

We have two programs to analyze data. 

PyBank reads in a financial report to find and calculate key values of interest such as average change, greatest increases and decreases and the totals for the year. These results are output into a textfile in Analysis.

PyPoll reads in a large record of poll results in an election and determines the winner, along with the percentage of votes earned by the other candidates and the number of participants.
